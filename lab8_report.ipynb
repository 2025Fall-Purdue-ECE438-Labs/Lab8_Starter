    "#### Introduction to Spatial Filtering\n",
    "Spatial filtering is a process used to enhance or restore images by manipulating pixel values in a local neighborhood. In this experiment, we will use spatial filtering to restore images affected by **pepper noise** (random black pixels) and **salt noise** (random white pixels).\n",
    "\n",
    "One effective filter for this type of noise is the **median filter**. The **median filter** is a type of order-statistic filter that replaces the value of a pixel with the **median** value of its neighboring pixels. This is particularly effective for removing salt-and-pepper noise without significantly blurring the edges of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another effective approach is using **max and min filters**, which can handle pepper and salt noise individually:\n",
    "- **Max Filter** is effective in reducing **pepper noise** by taking the maximum value within a local neighborhood, which helps to replace black pixels with brighter surrounding values.\n",
    "- **Min Filter** is effective in reducing **salt noise** by taking the minimum value within a local neighborhood, which helps to replace white pixels with darker surrounding values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Principle of Spatial Filtering\n",
    "To remove salt or pepper noise, we use spatial filters that smooth the image by averaging or taking other statistical measures of neighboring pixel values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Median Filter**:\n",
    "  $$ f_{\\text{median}}(x, y) = \\text{median} \\{ g(r, c) \\}, \\quad (r, c) \\in S_{xy} $$\n",
    "  Where $ S_{xy} $ represents the neighborhood around the pixel at position $ (x, y) $, and $ g(r, c) $ are the intensity values of pixels within the neighborhood. The median filter is particularly effective for removing salt or pepper noise without significantly blurring the edges of the image.\n",

In some cases, using an **adaptive median filter** can improve results by adjusting the filtering based on local image characteristics. The **adaptive median filter** works by changing the size of the neighborhood used for filtering until specific conditions are met. This makes it effective for images with high-density salt-and-pepper noise.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)**: PSNR, often expressed in decibels (dB), is based on the MSE but provides a standardized scale to evaluate image quality. A higher PSNR value indicates better image quality and less distortion from the original.\n",
